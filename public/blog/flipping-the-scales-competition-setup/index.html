            <p>
              I’m so happy that you’ve decided to join with your friends and family to lose weight as a group. For years
              my family and I have been hosting these types of competitions every so often - but we did it the old
              fashioned way, with a notebook and a pencil. I’ve built flippingthescales.com to eliminate that hassle.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to setup a competition just click on the 'Create Competition' link in the navigation bar. Note
              that you must be logged in to see the link.
            </p>

            <p>When you setup a competition you’ll need to make 4 choices about the structure of the competition.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold">Entry Fee</span> - Ok, this one is self explanatory. This is the amount that every
              participant needs to pay to enter the competition. The entry fee drives the overall prize pool. For each
              participant that enters the competition the prize pool is increased by their entry fee. For example, if 10
              participants enter a competition with a $50 entry fee the total prize pool will be $500.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Entry Fee</span> - The payout structure drives how the winner (or winners) of the
              competition will be paid. Three options are available:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>100% of the prize pool to 1st place</li>
              <li>75% of the prize pool to 1st place and 25% to 2nd place</li>
              <li>60% of the prize pool to 1st, 25% to 2nd, and 10% to 3rd place</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Interim Prizes</span> - A weight loss competition can get boring if everyone is just
              battling for the final prizes. Because of that I’ve introduced the option for interim prizes into the
              competition. Interim prizers are are paid to the participant with the highest percentage lost over a
              shorter time period (2 to 4 weeks).
            </p>
            <p>
              When selecting an interim prize you can either choose a payout of 5% of the total prize pool or 10% for
              each of the interim awards. If you choose to use interim awards in your competition these awards will be
              deducted from the prize pool that is available for distribution at the end of the competition.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold">Competition Length</span> - The final selection that needs to be made is then length of
              the competition. Flipping the Scales supports competitions that are between 8 and 20 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the four choices you’ll need to make about the structure of the competition, the
              competition creation screen also requires that you name your competition, select a start date, and gives
              you the opportunity to automatically send out email invitations to those that you would like to join the
              competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good luck to you, I hope you lose tons of weight, and if you have any questions or problems you can reach
              me at admin@flippingthescales.com.
